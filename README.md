## About Me
My name is Kat (just Kat, not short for anything) and I am located in Orlando, FL. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling and spending time with my family. I am also a Swiftie and like to obnoxiously quote Taylor Swift lyrics. 
## Past Coding Experience
My past coding experience is humble, mostly involving copying and pasting HTML code to personalize my Tumblr or WordPress blogs. Think less 'developer' and more 'decorator.'
## Career Goal
I desire to transition from my current path in the legal field to a more innovative and progressive industry. Since coding is integral to so many areas, Iâ€™m also open to exploring how these skills could help me transition into a different, tech-focused position within the legal field itself.
